# Requirements

* Users are asked a set of questions to which they have to respond.
After responding on their own, they can reveal the correct answers.

Depending on this the application will decide when to ask the questions again.

They can choose pages directly inside the application.

* Users can share a deck simply by transfering the deck file to the other person's computer.
