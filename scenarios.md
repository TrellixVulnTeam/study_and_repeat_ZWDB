# Scenarios

* Giulia is studying for an upcoming exam.
She opens the application _Study and Repeat_ and responds to the questions she
is asked, some of them are new to her and so she has to look at the answer,
however she confidently answers the other ones.

* Giulia needs to study for a new exam.
The exam requires her to remember a lot of things.
She decides it would be best to use the application _Study and Repeat_ in her
study sessions.
She opens the application and creates a new deck of question-aswer cards
related to the subject.
She adds cards to the deck, the answers are extracts from the professor's
slides.

* Giulia has a new exam to study for, but she doesn't have the time to build
her own deck.
She decides to study from her friend's deck that she saw yesterday.
She therefore adds it from the curated database and starts studying right away.

* Francesco has just taken an exam and got a really good grade.
He thinks this is thanks to his well built deck on _Study and Repeat_ and is
sure that many other students would benefit from it.
This is why he decides to request for the deck to be uploaded to the public
database for all people to use.
He is glad that this can be done easily from within the dedicated application
form.
