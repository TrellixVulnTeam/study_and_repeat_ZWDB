Giulia, 22 years old, is a college student studying economics.
The days before an exam she has long study sessions of up to eight hours a day. She isn't very satisfied with her study method, she would prefer to study less hours a day, over a longer period, but in a more efficient way.

Giulia loves using her laptop, which she often carries to university.
She thinks that this is the most convenient digital device, especially for long work sessions. Notwithstanding the love for her laptop, she doesn't integrate it in her study method, which is primarily focused around her notes taken during classes.

## Francesco

Francesco, 24 years old, is a master degree student in engineering.
His grades are well above average and this is mostly thanks to his many hours spent studying each day. He studies with his desktop pc from the professors' slides and notes but without following any particular study method and that's why he's looking for better alternative.

He usually tries to help his fellow students but he doesn't have enough time for everyone and that's why he would like to help all of them in one fell swoop.
